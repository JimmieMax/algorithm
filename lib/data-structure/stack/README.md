# Stack

In computer science, a **stack** is an abstract data type that serves 
as a collection of elements, with two principal operations:

* **push**, which adds an element to the collection, and
* **pop**, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its 
alternative name, LIFO (last in, first out). Additionally, a 
peek operation may give access to the top without modifying 
the stack. The name "stack" for this type of structure comes 
from the analogy to a set of physical items stacked on top of 
each other, which makes it easy to take an item off the top 
of the stack, while getting to an item deeper in the stack 
may require taking off multiple other items first.
